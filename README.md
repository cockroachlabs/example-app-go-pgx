This repo contains the source code for a simple CRUD application, written in Go. The application uses the [pgx driver](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/jackc/pgx) to connect to and communicate with an existing [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/) cluster.

For instructions on starting CockroachDB and running the code, see [this tutorial](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/build-a-go-app-with-cockroachdb.html).
